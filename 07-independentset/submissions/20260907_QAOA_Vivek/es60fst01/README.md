| Workflow | The solver iteratively applies classical reductions to fix provably optimal vertices, then runs hardware-aware QAOA to estimate marginal probabilities for the remaining vertices. It selects the highest-marginal vertex, adds it to the independent set, removes its closed neighborhood, and repeats on the reduced graph. When no vertices remain, the accumulated set is returned as the MIS. |
